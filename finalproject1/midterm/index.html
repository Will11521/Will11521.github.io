            <p>Jellyfish are some of the Earth's most ancient extant animals. They're also immensely diverse—most organisms that are called jellyfish are part of the phylum Cnidaria, which includes more than 10,000 species. Needless to say, they occur in abundant numbers all over the world, in cold and warm water, deep in the sea or near the surface. Most people are afraid to swim alongside them because of their painful sting, but not all jellyfish threaten injury.he human body is composed of 60% water and the jellyfish's 98%. When they wash ashore, they can disappear after just a few hours, their bodies promptly evaporating into the air. They have a rudimentary nervous system, a loose network of nerves located in the epidermis called a "nerve net," and no brain.  </p>

              One look at a jellyfish and this might seem rather obvious, but they aren't actually fish. They are invertebrates from the phylum Cnidaria and are so varied as a taxonomic group that many scientists have taken to simply referring to them as <em>"gelatinous zooplankton."</em>

              Jellyfish do not have scales, gills, or fins like fish. Instead, they swim by opening and closing their <em>"bells."</em></p>
