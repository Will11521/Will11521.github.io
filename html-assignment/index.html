      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <P>Hii I am <emp>William</emp>, I have done my 12<sup>th</sup> grade from india in Non Medical field and I am an individual who finds joy in the art of technology and language.  My journey has been marked by hunger of knowledge in the realms of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. This passion has driven me to explore innovative ways to make information more accessible and meaningful for users worldwide.
      I thought of going in computer programming but i got to know about this multi branch course that the college was offering that could make me explore my creativity as well as my problem solving skills</P>
      <p>After i enrolled in this course i researched about it and i felt i could do more justice to this instead of spending my time just coding for a company. I am more of a reader and like to read fictional books, the cult classics like "Pride and Prejudice"and much more.
      Besides reading, I also try to explore cliffs and hills and love to go on an adventurous trail now and then. There's this quote that motivates me a lot and I'm sure the readers are gonna love it too, It's by <b>Carol Burnett</b>,<i>"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go</i>  </p>
