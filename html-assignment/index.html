    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hii, I'm William, Yeah I know (Dad was a shakespeare enthusiast). Well just like the name I'm more into reading novels and books, mostly mystical or dark gothic. I've started writng a book myself and keen to discover the world of web designing and graphical ventures. I believe I have some hold over <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and basic css.
    </p>
    <p> I did my 12<sup>th</sup>grade in Non medical field that includes physics, chemistry, maths and english. Coming to Canada was more about exploring options and places and find the right path to go ahead and travel to places. The temperature difference here in unreal compared to where I've come from. I'm still making up my mind which carrer path to choose as Interactive Media Design course offers diverse fields. There's this one quote that I really love, "We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already." <em>- J.K. Rowling</em></p>
